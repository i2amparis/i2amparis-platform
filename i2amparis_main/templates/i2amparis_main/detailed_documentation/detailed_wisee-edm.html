                                <p>The industrial modules of WISEE-EDM are used to analyse possible futures of an industrial production system and to derive technically consistent paths to them, starting from the current production system.</p>

                                <p>Typical questions to the models are, for example:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"Which technologies will enable compliance with set CO2 emission reduction targets in 2050?"</li>
                                    <li>"When does a phase-in of break-through technologies need to start in order to reach a target state while maintaining usual reinvestment cycles?"</li>
                                    <li>"What energy sources are needed for a target pathway, in what quantities, when and where?"</li>
                                    <li>"What do future production networks look like technologically and geographically?"</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The models have a high level of technical detail and offer a variety of options for adapting the analysis to scenario-specific assumptions. They are therefore particularly suitable for developing scenarios in exchange with stakeholders.</p>

Sectors are partly sub-divided into several sub-sectors in the models. Note: the EDM-GS Global Steel Model is described in a separate entry in the database and will thus not be discussed in the following.

                                <p>The models and tools cover different industrial sub-sectors and levels of analysis and have a range of different purposes, for example material flow analysis (EDM-S) and investment optimization (EDM-I). The following gives a very brief account of each of the models in the family (see figure 1):</p>

                                <ul>
                                <li>The EDM-D draws on production levels that need to be provided as an input and on the EDM industry database (see below) to calculate the site-specific capacity utilization of production processes and for determining the resulting energy requirements and CO2 quantities. Among other things, the EDM-D enables a rule-based switch between energy carriers over time, whereby a substitution rule is created for a sector or process and made dependent on conditions (such as availability of an H2 infrastructure or availability of a CO2 infrastructure) and can be limited to certain locations or regions (e.g. states, NUTS-3 areas). Furthermore, the EDM-D balances by-products of industrial production (hydrogen, process steam, steam cracker by-products, coke oven, blast furnace and converter gases) and their further use in other processes at the level of sites or cross-site H2 and steam networks.</li>
                                <li>The EDM-I optimises the Europe-wide investments in production plants of the chemical industry from an economic point of view over a given period of time, taking into account the demand for end products in different years as well as transport costs between locations, taking into account product pipelines that exist between locations today. The EDM-I requires the specific production costs of individual technologies as well as other cost parameters. These are stored in the model, but can also be varied if necessary. The optimisation also results in the use of feedstock and the production quantities per (intermediate) product at different locations. A version of the EDM-I for the steel industry is currently under development (Dec 2022).</li>
                                <li>The EDM-S is a multi-regional dynamic Material Flow Analysis (MFA) of polymers technically based on the ODYM framework (Open Dynamic Material Systems Model). It aims to answer such questions as “which polymers are demanded in which quantities by which consumer sectors in any given year?” and “Which polymers enter the waste stream in which quantities and after how long in which use sectors in any given year?”. A version of the EDM-S for the steel industry is currently under development (Dec 2022). </li>
                                <li>The EDM-D_EU is a simplified version of the EDM-D that is used for the energy intensive industries except steel, chemicals and refineries at the EU27(+UK) level. It is used for activity-based modelling of mitigation pathways at country level (i.e. without explicit representation of production capacities).</li>
                                <li>The EDM-C is a tool for the cement sector that enables a structured derivation of cement and clinker required to satisfy an externally defined service demand for concrete buildings. This tool enables the consideration of developments and reduction levers at different levels of the cement and concrete sector ranging from efficiency of concrete use in concrete construction (e.g. leaner components) through binder shares in concretes and market shares of new binders to the use of different types of cements with various clinker contents.</li>
                                <li>The EDM-Steam is a tool to define technical pathways for the production of steam required for industrial production and to calculate according energy demands and CO2. It differentiates CHP and boilers fueled by different energy carriers as well as heat pumps.</li>
                                <li>The EDM-NE extrapolates energy demand for and CO2 emissions of the non-energy intensive industries based on economic indicators, efficiency parameters and technology shifts. It differentiates the non-energy intensive industry into three sectors and considers four different heat levels for each of them (room temp., < 150°C, 150-500°C, >500 °C).</li>
                                </ul>
                                

                                <p>The EDM-D and EDM-I modules draw on an extensive database of industrial plants currently (2022) covering the following industries:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>for EU-27+3: iron & steel, basic chemicals, refineries</li>
                                    <li>for Germany in addition: pulp & paper, non-ferrous metals, cement, lime, glass</li>

                                  Approx. 800 production sites in Europe. These are stored with GIS data and assigned to the EU member states and various NUTS levels. The linking of chemical industry sites and refineries by feedstock and product pipelines is also stored in the database. Furthermore, the (future) times of a connection of sites to a CO2 or H2 infrastructure can be specified (depending on the scenario).

Technologies are stored at different development and efficiency levels: at the standard of the European average of the years 2000 to 2005 (“default”) as well as the currently best available technology (“BAT”) and assumed further improved processes in the future (“BAT+”).

                                  Production levels are a main driver of the model. Economic growth is a main input variable to the definition of production level scenarios used by the model. Furthermore, effects of behavioural changes on production levels (e.g. less demand for cars) can be included in the specification of production level scenarios. The fine-grained differentiation of products by the model allows for a detailed representation of developments in the various industrial sectors.

                              <h2 class="mb-0 heading-new">Economic rationale and model solution</h2>
                              <p>The core principle behind the investment related part of the model (EDM-I) is that of societal costs of industrial production of a given amount of products. EDM-I is an optimization model that minimizes the investments and (simplified) operation costs over the whole simulated time period (while considering the value of assets at the end of the time period). </p>
                              <p>The dispatch model (EDM-D) and other models in the model family do not involve economic considerations but are purely technical models that are driven by externally set scenarios for production levels and technology replacement (e.g. as derived by use of the EDM-I). 
                                </p>
                              <p>Overall, the “solution” of the integrated model family typically consists of an iterative process of scenario outline (production levels, technology shifts, energy carrier shifts, infrastructure layout, …), model application and expert and stakeholder discussions.

                              <p>Each of the models and tools in the model family have their specific key parameters. The following abstracts from the single models to key parameters for scenario development with the model family.</p>
                              <p><b>Demand for products / Production levels</b></p>
                              <p>TDemand for products (including intermediary products) is a key driver of the model family. It can be externally set in the EDM-D / EDM-D_EU modules or be derived from other models such as the EDM-S, the EDM-I and the EDM-C. An ideal-typical interplay of the models for the chemical industry, for example, is to use the EDM-I to derive production levels (and capacities) for final and intermediary products that are required to satisfy an externally set demand for final products – while the EDM-S is used to calculate the amount of waste materials available as a further input to the EDM-I. </p>
                              <p><b>Technological development</b></p>
                              <p>
                                  Other central parameters are the years at which innovative production technologies are assumed to be available on an industrial scale and the speed of market penetration with BAT / BAT+ technologies.

                              </p>
                              <p><b>Infrastructure development</b></p>
                              <p>
                                  The time at which infrastructures (H2, CO2) will be available (in the future) is a (externally set) key influence factor for technology shifts and fuel switches. In the EDM-D it can / needs to be defined on a site-specific basis per scenario while the EDM-D_EU operates on the basis of capacity shares connected to infrastructure per country and year.

                              <p><b>Energy policy</b></p>
                              <p>The invest module (EDM-I) can directly assess the effects of energy related policies that affect prices (tax, subsidies) or availability of energy carriers (e.g. coal exit). In the dispatch module (EDM-D) the standard energy demand associated with the usage of particular production technologies may also be amended in a rule-based manner to cover fuel switches (e.g. coal exit, replacement of natural gas by biomethan etc.).   </p>
                              <p><b>R&D related policies</b></p>
                              <p>The model can assess the effects of R&D related policies by variation of the year from which on technologies are available on an industrial scale level. The model may be used to check the influence of such measures on the development of the industrial production stock – depending on the age composition of the plants, availability of infrastructure, and other factors.
                            Furthermore, policies that support the diffusion of innovative technologies can be  represented through variation of the replacement rate of standard technologies through best available technologies as well as further improved technologies.
                            </p>
                              <p><b>Infrastructure related policies</b></p>
                              <p>The model can assess the effects of infrastructure related policies and regulations through variation of industry sites’ connection to infrastructures (EDM-D) / variation of the capacity shares connected to innovative infrastructures per country and year (EDM-D_EU).</p>

                                             The Port of Rotterdam industrial cluster is heavily exposed to future
                                              decarbonisation policies, as most of its activities focus on trading,
                                              handling, converting and using fossil fuels. Using a mixture of
                                              qualitative and quantitative methods, the article explores three pathways
                                              whereby the port’s industry can maintain its strong position while
                                              significantly reducing its CO2 emissions and related risks by 2050.
                                              Depending on mitigation target and choice of mitigation strategies,
                                              future technologies and infrastructure may differ greatly. Almost full
                                              decarbonisation of the cluster can be achieved by 2050, possibly even
                                              without CCS.

                                              The paper describes quantitative scenarios on a possible evolution of the
                                              EU petrochemical industry towards climate neutrality. The
                                              cost-optimization model used to develop the scenarios describes at which
                                              sites investments of industry in the production stock could take place in
                                              the future. Around 50 types of products, the related production processes
                                              and the respective sites have been collected in a database. The processes
                                              included cover the production chain from platform chemicals via
                                              intermediates to polymers. Pipelines allowing for efficient exchange of
                                              feedstock and platform chemicals between sites are taken into account as
                                              well. The model draws on this data to simulate capacity change at
                                              individual plants as well as plant utilization. Thus, a future European
                                              production network for petrochemicals with flows between the different
                                              sites and steps of the value chain can be sketched. The scenarios
                                              described in this paper reveal how an electrification strategy could be
                                              implemented by European industry over time with minimized societal costs.

                                            HTCOE can become economically competitive for currently discussed CO2 prices.
