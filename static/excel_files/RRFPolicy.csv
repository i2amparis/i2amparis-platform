"Decarbonising homes and public sector buildings","To decarbonise homes, workplaces, schools and hospitals, the UK Government will: •	Develop a UK heat pump manufacturing base and expand existing supply chains for building efficiency. The aim is to install 600,000 heat pumps per year by 2028, creating a market led incentive framework to drive growth, and bring forward regulations to support this, especially in off gas grid properties. This aim leaves the UK Government with the choice on whether to pursue hydrogen heating, an electrified heating system, or a mixture of both, whilst they pilot the options. •	To avoid retrofitting, the UK Government will seek to implement the Future Home Standard in the shortest possible timeline, and consult shortly on increased standards for non-domestic buildings so that new buildings have high levels of energy efficiency and low carbon heating. New homes will have 75–80% lower carbon dioxide emissions than those built to current standards. •	Extend the Green Homes Grant for another year to improve the energy efficiency of homes and replace fossil fuel heating •	Reduce emissions in schools, hospitals and public buildings by providing further funding for Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme •	Transform the lives of more homeowners who live off the gas grid, particularly in rural areas, with upgrades to their heating systems through the Homes Upgrade Grant •	Commit to further funding for the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund to continue upgrading the least efficient social housing •	Strengthen energy efficiency requirements for private sector landlords. To support those least able-to-pay, the UK Government will extend the Energy Company Obligation to 2026, so suppliers can help improve the draughtiest and coldest homes •	Launch an improved Energy Technology List website.  •	Kickstart the green home finance market by consulting on introducing mandatory disclosure requirements for lenders on the energy performance of homes on which they lend and setting voluntary improvement targets.

Further, the analyses will not increase appropriations, except in cases where they can be classified as of ""code 8,"" i.e., expenditures that produce savings. - Identify which policies are no longer consistent with the Community Policy Statement, or are no longer sufficiently effective in terms of the objectives they seek to achieve, and which could be abandoned. - Reach initial conclusions before the summer of 2021, so that feedback can be obtained before the initial 2022 budget is prepared. The results of the analyses will be submitted to the Government, which will decide on the follow-up to the conclusions of the analyses, and in particular on the possible allocation of the budgetary benefits to the Federation as a whole or to the specific policies from which they derive, on the proposal of the competent Minister.

Where no investment has already been made to activate that entitlement, such as vessel conversion in cases where an owner has committed to changing fishing method, these entitlements would be revoked.  •	Scotland will ensure more effective compliance by extending the requirement for vessel tracking and monitoring systems across the whole commercial fishing fleet by the end of the current parliamentary session, and increasing capacity and capability in marine monitoring and protection.","United Kingdom","0","0","Green","Other/Uncategorised"

This know-how, as demonstrated during the decommissioning of the BR3 reactor, has proven beneficial effects on the final volumes of radioactive waste produced and their safe management. The BR3 reactor was a PWR-type reactor which was a model for the Belgian nuclear power plants, however on a smaller scale. The added value offered by this project therefore mainly focuses on controlling and minimizing the final amount of radioactive waste during decommissioning, through innovations in characterization and decontamination of bulk materials (metals, concrete), as well as integrating innovative digital technologies and developments in the material management system.
